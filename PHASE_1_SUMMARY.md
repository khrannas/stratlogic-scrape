#### 4. Basic Project Structure
- âœ… Created complete `src/` directory structure:
  ```
  src/
  â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Core configuration, models, utils
  â”œâ”€â”€ api/            # API routes and middleware
  â”œâ”€â”€ scrapers/       # Scraping modules
  â”œâ”€â”€ storage/        # Storage operations
  â”œâ”€â”€ services/       # Business logic services
  â””â”€â”€ main.py         # FastAPI application
  ```
- âœ… Set up core modules with proper imports and structure
- âœ… Created basic FastAPI application with health checks
- âœ… Set up testing framework with pytest configuration

#### 5. Docker Setup
- âœ… Created `Dockerfile` for application containerization
- âœ… Created `docker-compose.yml` with all services:
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Redis cache
  - MinIO object storage
  - Main application
  - Celery workers
- âœ… Configured development and production environments
- âœ… Set up volume mounts and networking

  - Artifacts with metadata
  - System configuration
  - Audit logging
  - API keys management
- âœ… Created database initialization script (`scripts/init-db.sql`)
- âœ… Set up SQLAlchemy ORM with proper relationships

#### 7. Storage Integration
- âœ… Created MinIO client (`src/storage/minio_client.py`) with:
  - File upload/download operations
  - Data streaming capabilities
  - Metadata management
  - Presigned URL generation
  - Object listing and management

#### 8. Background Task Processing

   - Hash calculation
   - Presigned URL generation

5. **Utility Functions** (`src/core/utils.py`)
   - Logging setup
   - File handling utilities
   - URL validation and normalization
   - Data formatting helpers

### Testing Setup:
- âœ… Created pytest configuration (`pytest.ini`)
- âœ… Set up test structure with example tests
- âœ… Configured test markers for different test types

### Documentation:
- âœ… Updated README with project overview
- âœ… Created comprehensive environment template

## ðŸš€ Next Steps - Phase 1 Remaining Tasks

### Task 02: Database Schema and Models - READY TO START
- [ ] Create database migrations with Alembic
- [ ] Implement database repositories/DAOs
- [ ] Add database connection pooling
- [ ] Create database seeding scripts
- [ ] Add database health checks

### Task 03: MinIO Storage Integration - READY TO START
- [ ] Implement metadata manager
- [ ] Add file validation and processing
- [ ] Create storage policies and lifecycle management
- [ ] Implement backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Add storage monitoring and metrics

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Start Development

### Prerequisites:
1. Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. Python 3.11+ installed
3. Git repository cloned

### Quick Start:
1. Copy environment template:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. Run the startup script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start.sh
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Health Check: http://localhost:8000/health
   - MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001

### Development Commands:
```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Start services only
docker-compose up -d postgres redis minio

# Start application in development mode
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload

# Run Celery worker
celery -A src.core.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
```

## ðŸ“Š Project Status

- **Phase 1 Progress**: 1/3 tasks completed (33%)
- **Overall Progress**: 1/13 tasks completed (8%)
- **Next Milestone**: Complete Phase 1 (Database and Storage integration)

## ðŸ”§ Technical Debt & Improvements

1. **Add more comprehensive tests** for all modules
