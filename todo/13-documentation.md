- [ ] Create tutorials and step-by-step examples.
- [ ] Develop a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section.

### 13.2 API Documentation
- [ ] Ensure the auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger documentation is complete and accurate.
- [ ] Add detailed descriptions, examples, and authentication information to all endpoints.
- [ ] Create a high-level overview of the API architecture and design principles.

### 13.3 Developer and Administrator Documentation
- [ ] Write a developer guide covering project setup, architecture, and coding conventions.
- [ ] Create a system administration guide covering deployment, monitoring, and maintenance.
- [ ] Document the backup and disaster recovery procedures in detail.
- [ ] Document the CI/CD pipeline and release process.

### 13.4 Training Materials
- [ ] Prepare presentation slides or a video tutorial for user training.
- [ ] Create hands-on labs or exercises for users to practice with the system.

## Subtasks

### Subtask 13.1.1: User Guide Structure
-   **Introduction**: System overview and purpose.
-   **Getting Started**: How to register and log in.
-   **Core Features**: Detailed guides for each feature.
-   **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions.

### Subtask 13.3.1: Developer Onboarding
-   The developer guide should make it possible for a new developer to set up their environment and start contributing within a few hours.
-   Include diagrams for the system architecture.

### Subtask 13.4.1: Training Session
-   Plan and schedule a training session for the target users.
-   Gather feedback during the session to improve the documentation and the system itself.

## Files to Create

1.  `docs/user_guide/getting_started.md`
2.  `docs/user_guide/scraping_guide.md`
3.  `docs/user_guide/search_guide.md`
4.  `docs/user_guide/faq.md`
5.  `docs/api/overview.md`
6.  `docs/api/authentication.md`
7.  `docs/developer_guide/project_setup.md`
8.  `docs/developer_guide/architecture.md`
9.  `docs/admin_guide/maintenance.md`
10. `training/user_training_presentation.md` (or .pptx)
11. `training/labs/lab_1_first_scrape.md`

## Testing

### Documentation Review
- [ ] Have a non-developer read the user guide to check for clarity and completeness.
- [ ] Have a new developer follow the developer guide to set up the project.
- [ ] Proofread all documentation for grammatical errors and typos.
- [ ] Validate all code examples and commands in the documentation.

## Documentation
This entire task is about creating documentation.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Medium Risk Items

#### 1. Outdated Documentation
**Risk**: Documentation can quickly become outdated as the system evolves.
**Mitigation Strategies**:
-   **"Docs as Code"**: Treat documentation as part of the codebase. Require documentation updates as part of the pull request process for new features or changes.
-   **Automated Checks**: Implement checks in the CI pipeline to look for missing documentation for new API endpoints.
-   **Regular Reviews**: Schedule periodic reviews of all documentation to ensure it remains accurate.

#### 2. Low User Adoption of Docs
**Risk**: Users might not read the documentation.
**Mitigation Strategies**:
-   **Make it Accessible**: Host the documentation in an easy-to-find and searchable format (e.g., a static site generated with MkDocs or Docusaurus).
-   **Keep it Concise**: Use clear language, diagrams, and screenshots. Avoid long walls of text.
-   **In-App Help**: Link directly to relevant documentation pages from within the application's UI.

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] A complete set of documentation for all target audiences is created.
- [ ] Documentation has been reviewed and validated for accuracy and clarity.
- [ ] Training materials are prepared and ready for delivery.
