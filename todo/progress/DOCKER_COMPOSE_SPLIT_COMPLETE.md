# Docker Compose Split for Development - Task Complete ✅

## Overview

Successfully split the Docker Compose configuration to enable local development with infrastructure dependencies running in Docker containers. This allows developers to run the main application locally while keeping PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO in Docker for consistency.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Split Docker Compose Files

**`docker-compose.deps.yml`** - Infrastructure Dependencies Only
- PostgreSQL database service
- Redis cache service  
- MinIO object storage service
- All necessary volumes and networks
- Health checks for all services

**`docker-compose.yml`** - Application Services Only
- FastAPI main application
- Celery worker service
- Celery beat scheduler service
- References external network from deps file

### 2. Development Scripts

**Windows (PowerShell):** `scripts/dev-deps.ps1`
- Start/stop/restart dependencies
- Check service status
- View logs
- Reset dependencies (remove volumes)
- Colored output and user-friendly interface

**Linux/macOS:** `scripts/dev-deps.sh`
- Same functionality as PowerShell version
- Bash-compatible syntax
- Executable permissions

### 3. Development Environment Configuration

**`env.development`** - Local Development Environment
- Correct localhost URLs for all services
- Development-specific configuration
- Ready-to-use environment variables

### 4. Documentation

**`docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`** - Comprehensive Guide
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Service URLs and access information
- Tips for efficient development workflow

## Benefits Achieved

### For Developers
1. **Faster Development Cycle**: No need to rebuild Docker images for code changes
2. **Hot Reload**: FastAPI automatically reloads on code changes
3. **Better Debugging**: Direct access to application logs and debugging tools
4. **IDE Integration**: Full IDE support for local development
5. **Faster Startup**: Only dependencies need to start, not the full application stack

### For the Project
1. **Consistent Dependencies**: Infrastructure services remain in Docker for consistency
2. **Flexible Deployment**: Can still use full Docker Compose for production
3. **Easy Switching**: Simple commands to switch between development and production modes
4. **Reduced Resource Usage**: Only runs necessary services during development

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start (Windows)
```powershell
# Start dependencies
.\scripts\dev-deps.ps1 start

# Set environment
copy env.development .env

# Run application locally
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Quick Start (Linux/macOS)
```bash
# Start dependencies
./scripts/dev-deps.sh start

# Set environment
cp env.development .env

# Run application locally
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Service Access Points

When dependencies are running:
- **FastAPI App**: http://localhost:8000
- **FastAPI Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432
- **Redis**: localhost:6379
- **MinIO API**: localhost:9000
- **MinIO Console**: http://localhost:9001

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `docker-compose.deps.yml` - Infrastructure dependencies
- `scripts/dev-deps.ps1` - Windows development script
- `scripts/dev-deps.sh` - Linux/macOS development script
- `env.development` - Development environment configuration
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Development workflow guide

### Modified Files
- `docker-compose.yml` - Updated to contain only application services
- `todo/00-master-todo.md` - Added task completion entry

## Next Steps

1. **Start Phase 2**: Begin API and Authentication development (Task 04 & 05)
2. **Use New Workflow**: Developers should use the new development workflow for faster iteration
3. **Update Documentation**: Keep development workflow documentation updated as the project evolves
4. **Consider CI/CD**: Integrate the split Docker Compose setup into CI/CD pipelines

## Notes

- The split maintains full compatibility with the existing Docker setup
- Production deployments can still use the full `docker-compose.yml`
- All health checks and networking remain intact
- The external network approach ensures proper service communication
- Development scripts provide a user-friendly interface for managing dependencies

## Task Status: ✅ COMPLETED

This task has been successfully completed and is ready for use by the development team. The new workflow will significantly improve development efficiency and reduce iteration time.
