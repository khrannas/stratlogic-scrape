# Task 12: Deployment and Production Setup

## Overview
Prepare the system for production deployment. This includes creating production-ready Docker configurations, setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments, and configuring monitoring, logging, and backup procedures.

## Priority: High
## Estimated Time: 2-3 days
## Dependencies: Tasks 01-11

## Checklist

### 12.1 Production Docker Configuration
- [ ] Create a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for a smaller, more secure production image.
- [ ] Create a `docker-compose.prod.yml` for the production environment.
- [ ] Use production-specific settings and secrets management.
- [ ] Remove development tools and dependencies from the production image.

### 12.2 CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
- [ ] Automate testing, building, and pushing Docker images to a container registry.
- [ ] Create a deployment workflow for staging and production environments.
- [ ] Implement manual approval steps for production deployments.

### 12.3 Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Configure centralized logging for all services (e.g., using the ELK stack or a cloud service).
- [ ] Set up production monitoring and alerting (re-using the setup from Task 10).
- [ ] Implement health checks for all services that can be used by an orchestrator.

### 12.4 Backup and Recovery
- [ ] Develop and document a backup strategy for the PostgreSQL database.
- [ ] Develop and document a backup strategy for MinIO object storage.
- [ ] Create and test a disaster recovery plan.

## Subtasks

### Subtask 12.1.1: Production Dockerfile
-   Use a slim base image (e.g., `python:3.11-slim`).
-   Copy only the necessary application files, not tests or development configurations.
-   Run the application as a non-root user.

### Subtask 12.2.1: CI/CD Workflow
-   **On Pull Request**: Run linting, unit tests, and security scans.
-   **On Merge to `main`**: Build and push Docker image to registry, deploy to staging.
-   **On Tag/Release**: Deploy to production (with manual approval).

### Subtask 12.4.1: Database Backup
-   Use a tool like `pg_dump` to create regular backups.
-   Store backups in a secure, remote location (e.g., a separate MinIO bucket or S3).

## Files to Create

1.  `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production Docker Compose file.
2.  `Dockerfile.prod` - Optimized Dockerfile for production.
3.  `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - CI/CD pipeline for deployment.
4.  `scripts/backup.sh` - Script to perform database and storage backups.
5.  `scripts/restore.sh` - Script to restore from backups.
6.  `config/gunicorn.conf.py` - Configuration for the Gunicorn WSGI server in production.
7.  `docs/deployment_guide.md` - Guide on how to deploy and manage the application.
8.  `docs/disaster_recovery_plan.md` - The disaster recovery plan.

## Testing

### Deployment Tests
- [ ] Perform a full deployment to a staging environment that mirrors production.
- [ ] Verify that all services start correctly and can communicate with each other.
- [ ] Run a smoke test suite against the staging environment after deployment.

### Recovery Tests
- [ ] Test the backup and restore procedures to ensure they are working correctly.
- [ ] Simulate a failure (e.g., delete the database) and test the disaster recovery plan.

## Documentation

- [ ] Document the entire CI/CD pipeline and deployment process.
- [ ] Provide detailed instructions on how to set up a new production environment.
- [ ] Document the backup and recovery procedures.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Risk Items

#### 1. Downtime During Deployment
**Risk**: Deployments can fail, causing service downtime.
**Mitigation Strategies**:
-   **Blue-Green or Canary Deployments**: Implement an advanced deployment strategy to reduce the risk of failed deployments affecting all users.
-   **Automated Rollbacks**: Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automatically roll back to the previous version if health checks fail after a deployment.
-   **Staging Environment**: Thoroughly test all changes in a staging environment before deploying to production.

#### 2. Data Loss
**Risk**: A system failure or mistake could lead to permanent data loss.
**Mitigation Strategies**:
-   **Automated, Regular Backups**: Ensure backups are performed automatically and frequently.
-   **Off-site Backups**: Store backups in a different physical location or cloud region.
-   **Test Restores**: Regularly test the restore process to ensure backups are valid and usable.
-   **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**: Configure the database for PITR if granular recovery is needed.

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] The application can be deployed to production automatically via the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Production monitoring and logging are in place and functional.
- [ ] A robust backup and recovery plan is implemented and tested.
- [ ] The deployment process is well-documented.
