# Task 10: Advanced Features and Optimization

## Overview
Implement advanced features such as real-time monitoring, advanced content analysis, and performance optimization. This task aims to enhance the system's capabilities, efficiency, and user experience.

## Priority: Medium
## Estimated Time: 4-5 days
## Dependencies: Tasks 01-09

## Checklist

### 10.1 Real-Time Monitoring and Analytics
- [ ] Set up a real-time dashboard for system metrics (e.g., using Grafana/Prometheus)
- [ ] Monitor scraping job status, performance, and errors in real-time
- [ ] Track API usage and response times
- [ ] Implement alerting for system anomalies

### 10.2 Advanced Content Analysis
- [ ] Integrate a more advanced NLP pipeline for entity recognition and sentiment analysis
- [ ] Implement topic modeling for scraped documents
- [ ] Develop a content summarization feature
- [ ] Use embedding models for semantic search capabilities

### 10.3 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile and identify performance bottlenecks in the API and scrapers
- [ ] Optimize database queries and add caching layers where appropriate (e.g., Redis)
- [ ] Optimize resource usage (CPU, memory) of scraping processes
- [ ] Implement asynchronous processing for long-running tasks

### 10.4 Advanced Search
- [ ] Implement full-text search over scraped documents (e.g., using Elasticsearch or similar)
- [ ] Implement faceted search based on metadata (source, date, author)
- [ ] Integrate semantic search results from the content analysis pipeline

## Subtasks

### Subtask 10.1.1: Monitoring Stack
-   Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.
-   Instrument the FastAPI application and scrapers to expose Prometheus metrics.

### Subtask 10.2.1: NLP Integration
-   Choose and integrate an NLP library like spaCy or a transformer-based model from Hugging Face.
-   Create a service to process documents and store the enriched data (entities, topics, summaries).

### Subtask 10.3.1: Caching Strategy
-   Identify frequently accessed, non-volatile data.
-   Implement a caching layer using Redis for API responses, database queries, and session data.

### Subtask 10.4.1: Elasticsearch Integration
-   Set up an Elasticsearch cluster.
-   Create a data pipeline to index scraped documents into Elasticsearch.
-   Build an API endpoint to query Elasticsearch.

## Files to Create

1.  `src/services/monitoring_service.py` - Service to expose application metrics.
2.  `docker/prometheus/prometheus.yml` - Prometheus configuration.
3.  `docker/grafana/provisioning/` - Grafana dashboard definitions.
4.  `src/services/nlp_service.py` - Service for advanced content analysis.
5.  `src/services/search_service.py` - Service to interact with the search index.
6.  `src/api/routers/analytics.py` - API endpoints for analytics and monitoring data.
7.  `src/core/cache.py` - Caching utility setup.
8.  `scripts/index_data.py` - Script to bulk-index data into the search engine.
9.  `config/elasticsearch.py` - Elasticsearch configuration.
10. `config/nlp_models.py` - Configuration for NLP models.

## Testing

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Conduct load testing on the API to measure performance improvements.
- [ ] Benchmark scraping job execution time before and after optimizations.
- [ ] Test search query response times.

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test the full monitoring pipeline (app -> Prometheus -> Grafana).
- [ ] Test the NLP processing pipeline.
- [ ] Test the integration with the search index, ensuring data is indexed and searchable correctly.

## Documentation

- [ ] Document the monitoring and alerting setup.
- [ ] Document the advanced analysis features and their API usage.
- [ ] Provide a guide on how to use the advanced search capabilities.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Medium Risk Items

#### 1. Complexity of New Components
**Risk**: Integrating complex systems like Elasticsearch and a full NLP pipeline can be challenging.
**Mitigation Strategies**:
-   **Start with managed services**: Consider using managed cloud services (e.g., AWS Elasticsearch Service) to reduce operational overhead.
-   **Phased rollout**: Implement features incrementally. Start with basic full-text search before moving to semantic search.
-   **Thorough PoCs**: Conduct proof-of-concept projects to evaluate technologies before full integration.

#### 2. Resource Consumption
**Risk**: Advanced features, especially NLP models and real-time monitoring, can be resource-intensive.
**Mitigation Strategies**:
-   **Resource profiling**: Profile the resource usage of new components under load.
-   **Asynchronous processing**: Move heavy processing tasks to background workers to avoid blocking the main application.
-   **Scalable infrastructure**: Ensure the infrastructure can scale to handle the additional load.

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Real-time monitoring dashboard is live and reporting key metrics.
- [ ] Advanced content analysis features are integrated and functional.
- [ ] Measurable performance improvements have been achieved.
- [ ] Advanced search capabilities are available through the API.
