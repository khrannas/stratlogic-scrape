# Task 11: System Integration and Testing

## Overview
Integrate all system components and conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the system is reliable, performant, and secure. This includes end-to-end testing, performance testing, and security vulnerability scanning.

## Priority: High
## Estimated Time: 3-4 days
## Dependencies: Tasks 01-10

## Checklist

### 11.1 End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- [ ] Develop E2E test cases for the main user flows.
- [ ] Automate E2E tests using a framework like Playwright or Cypress for the frontend, and `pytest` for the backend.
- [ ] Test the full lifecycle of a scraping job: creation, execution, data storage, and retrieval.
- [ ] Verify the integration between the API, database, storage, and scrapers.

### 11.2 Performance Testing
- [ ] Define performance benchmarks and goals (e.g., response time, throughput).
- [ ] Use a tool like Locust or `k6` to simulate user load on the API.
- [ ] Conduct stress tests to identify the system's breaking point.
- [ ] Analyze performance test results and identify bottlenecks.

### 11.3 Security Testing
- [ ] Perform vulnerability scanning on the application and its dependencies (e.g., using `bandit`, `safety`).
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing on the API to identify common vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, etc.).
- [ ] Review authentication and authorization implementation for security flaws.
- [ ] Scan container images for known vulnerabilities.

### 11.4 Test Suite Enhancement
- [ ] Increase overall test coverage, aiming for a high percentage for critical modules.
- [ ] Refactor existing tests for clarity and efficiency.
- [ ] Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to run all tests automatically on every commit.

## Subtasks

### Subtask 11.1.1: E2E Test Scenarios
-   **User Registration and Login Flow**: A user registers, logs in, and receives a token.
-   **Scraping Job Flow**: A logged-in user creates a job, the system executes it, stores the artifact in MinIO, and the user can view the results.
-   **Search Flow**: A user performs a search and retrieves relevant documents.

### Subtask 11.2.1: Load Test Setup
-   Write load test scripts that simulate realistic user behavior.
-   Set up a dedicated environment for performance testing to not interfere with development.

### Subtask 11.3.1: Security Scanning in CI
-   Integrate security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to fail builds on critical vulnerabilities.

## Files to Create

-   `tests/e2e/test_user_flow.py`
-   `tests/e2e/test_scraping_flow.py`
-   `tests/e2e/test_search_flow.py`
-   `tests/performance/locustfile.py` - Load testing scripts.
-   `tests/security/` - Folder for security-related test scripts and reports.
-   `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI pipeline configuration that includes all testing stages.
-   `tests/conftest.py` - Additional fixtures for E2E tests.
-   (And at least 8 more test files to meet the 15+ file count, e.g., breaking down E2E tests into smaller, more manageable files).
-   `tests/e2e/api/test_auth_e2e.py`
-   `tests/e2e/api/test_jobs_e2e.py`
-   `tests/e2e/scrapers/test_web_scraper_e2e.py`
-   `tests/e2e/scrapers/test_paper_scraper_e2e.py`
-   `tests/e2e/scrapers/test_gov_scraper_e2e.py`
-   `tests/e2e/frontend/test_dashboard_e2e.spec.ts`
-   `tests/e2e/frontend/test_login_e2e.spec.ts`
-   `tests/e2e/frontend/test_search_e2e.spec.ts`

## Testing
This entire task is about testing. The "Testing" section is covered by the checklists and subtasks above.

## Documentation

- [ ] Document the E2E testing strategy and how to run the tests.
- [ ] Create a report of the performance test results and findings.
- [ ] Document the security vulnerabilities found and the steps taken to remediate them.
- [ ] Update the main README with instructions on how to run the full test suite.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Medium Risk Items

#### 1. Flaky E2E Tests
**Risk**: End-to-end tests can be brittle and fail due to timing issues or minor UI changes.
**Mitigation Strategies**:
-   **Stable Test Environment**: Run E2E tests in a dedicated, controlled environment.
-   **Robust Selectors**: Use stable, non-changing selectors (e.g., `data-testid` attributes) instead of CSS classes or XPath.
-   **Wait Strategies**: Implement explicit waits for elements to be present/visible/interactive instead of fixed delays.
-   **Test Retries**: Configure the test runner to automatically retry failed tests.

#### 2. Inaccurate Performance Tests
**Risk**: Performance tests might not reflect real-world usage, leading to a false sense of security.
**Mitigation Strategies**:
-   **Realistic Scenarios**: Base test scenarios on actual user data and analytics.
-   **Production-like Environment**: Run tests in an environment that is as close to production as possible.
-   **Analyze Results Carefully**: Don't just look at averages; analyze percentile data (p95, p99) to understand the experience of all users.

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] A comprehensive suite of automated E2E tests is in place and passes consistently.
- [ ] Performance testing has been conducted, and a baseline is established.
- [ ] Security testing has been performed, and all critical vulnerabilities have been addressed.
- [ ] The CI pipeline is configured to run all tests automatically.
